## Q&A RAG Pipeline using Langchain, Typesense and OpenAI API ##

This documentation outlines the step-by-step process of creating the Question-Answering (Q&A) application powered by a knowledge graph. The project aimed to provide users with a platform to ask questions in natural language and receive relevant answers from a knowledge base.

Objectives
Develop a Q&A system capable of understanding natural language queries.
Implement a knowledge graph to store and retrieve information.
Utilize advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for question answering.
Create a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Technologies Used
Backend Technologies:
Python: Used for backend development.
Typesense: Used for building the search functionality and managing the knowledge base.

Libraries and Tools:
Transformers Library: Utilized for pre-trained language models and NLP tasks.
Git: Used for version control and collaboration among the development team.

Development Process
1. Planning and Design:
Objective Setting: Clearly defined project objectives and requirements.
Architecture Design: Designed the application architecture, including database schema and API endpoints.
UI Design: Created wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface.

2. Backend Development:
Flask Setup: Initialized the Flask application and defined routes for handling HTTP requests.
NLP Integration: Integrated the Transformers library for natural language processing tasks.
Knowledge Base Implementation: Implemented functionalities for storing and retrieving data from the knowledge base using Typesense.

Challenges Faced
Natural Language Understanding: Developing accurate NLP models posed challenges due to the complexity of human language.
Performance Optimization: Optimizing the application for speed and efficiency, especially with large data volumes, required careful consideration.
User Interface Design: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that caters to users with varying levels of technical expertise was challenging.

Future Improvements
Enhanced NLP Models: Incorporate more advanced NLP models and techniques to improve question answering accuracy.
Scalability: Implement strategies to scale the application infrastructure to handle increasing user demand.
